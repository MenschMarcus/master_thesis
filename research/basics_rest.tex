A GIS shall solve the problem for a user or answer his or her research question. Given a well-filled database with a working DBMS, the data might not answer the research question directly. It has to be sorted, selected or classified in order to convey the required information. For this process there are \emph{spatial operations} on the data in the system. Several operations can be applied in a certain order
\cite[pp. 321-325]{bolstad2008gis}.
Both spatial and attribute data are analyzed to combine the dimensions \emph{where?} and \emph{what?} in order to answer the ultimate question \emph{why?} something is the way it is
\cite[p.xii-xvi]{knowles2002past}.

An example is a system visualizing social developments on Earth. The researcher wants to divide the world into five regions with a similar life expectancy to see if there are spatial discrepancy of advances in global health. He or she has a GIS with all countries and their current life expectancy stored. In order to answer his or her research question, the following steps may be required

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Extract the life expectancy value per country.
  \item Classify the values on a discrete scale from very low to very high and put each country into one of the five classes.
  \item Unify neighboring countries that are in the same class to get five world regions.
  \item Name the five world regions.
  \item Apply a color scheme to the classification and set the background color for each of the five world regions.
  \item Create a legend with the classification and the explanation of the symbols.
  \item Present the resulting map on the screen.
\end{enumerate}

There are special operations for raster data, e.g. spatial interpolation, and for vector data.

Only explain those later that are really important!

Cartographic visualizations are the interface between the GIS and the human. A map is is the common form. It is a discrete graphical expression of the continuous real world. The creation of a map is not just a scientific, but also a creative process: The form, function and interaction methods shall follow the purpose of the usage of the map.

There is no fixed guideline how to properly design a map, but there are typical elements that are part of every cartographic visualization.The main element is the map itself, using a specific map projection
% (see section \ref{ssub:map_projections})
, a scale and an initial center point. A map is typically structured in a \emph{layer} principle. Each layer is a transparent film showing one specific aspect, e.g. a physical layer showing coastlines, mountains or forests, a political layer showing international borders or a cultural layer showing cities or population densities. The layers are interchangeable, can be switched on and off and serve to serve a different visualization purpose. The map is designed using a certain color scheme, fonts and signatures for all the objects on the map.

Additionally there can be a \emph{title} describing the purpose of the map. A \emph{legend} including the scale bar and north arrow shall explain all symbols used on the map and give orientation. Depending on the degree of interactivity, there can be \emph{menus} with different visualization options, e.g. panning and zooming on the map, switching map layers on and off or changing the color scheme of the map.
\cite[pp. 159-166]{bolstad2008gis}

% example of a good map

The main goal of map design is to give the user nothing but the necessary information he needs to satisfy his or her information need. The cartographer shall use techniques of \emph{cartographic generalization} to minimize information on the map and maximize the knowledge to be extracted from the map. Simplification, smoothing or aggregation help to reduce amount of information. Enlarging, widening or displacement help to focus on the important areas of the map. Selection and classification help the user to get an overview of the information.

\paragraph{Map Projections} % (fold)
\label{par:map_projections}

One task of a HGIS is to visualize the Earth on a map. Since the Earth is an inhomogeneous three-dimensional shape but the output medium is a two-dimensional computer screen or piece of paper, it has to be transformed.

Based on the geodetic datum a three-dimensional representation of the Earth in form of a globe would be a possible medium to view the planet. When seen perpendicular onto the world, a globe represents sizes, shapes, distances and directions of objects close to the viewpoint with a reasonable accuracy. However, they are very space-consuming and cumbersome. For a precise measurement of distances, following a route or examining a terrain model, the globe would have to be very large. Therefore, the desired medium for practical purposes is a two-dimensional map.

The basic problem to be solved is that the Earth is a spherical object, its surface is curved and it is therefore not straightforward to project it onto a flat 2D map. The meridians which are lines of equal value converge at the poles. Neighboring meridians (distance: 1\degree) have a distance of 111 km at the Equator and 0 km at the poles. They do not form a right-angled grid with the parallels and therefore no Cartesian coordinate system. This is the reason why the geometries of the spherical Earth will be distorted when displayed on a flat 2D Cartesian coordinate system. \cite[p.79]{bolstad2008gis}

% \begin{figure}[ht]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth]{graphics/basics/distortion}
%   \caption{Distortion visualized by circles on a 2D map as a Cartesian coordinate system}
%   (on the 3D Earth all circles have the same size)
%   \label{fig:distortion}
% \end{figure}

There are two main classifications of map projections: The \emph{projection family} with respect to the geometric shape used for the transformation: \emph{cylindrical}, \emph{conical} and \emph{azimuthal} or \emph{planar projection}). Secondly, the \emph{distortion characteristics} with respect to the map property that is preserved. There are \emph{equivalent}, \emph{conformal}, \emph{equidistant}, \emph{zenithal} and compromise projections. Most families and characteristics can be mixed, e.g. it is possible to create a cylindrical, a conical and an azimuthal equivalent map projection
\cite{mapProjectionKrygier}.


\paragraph{Projection Families} % (fold)
\label{subp:projection_families}

The basis of geometrical map projections are \emph{developable surfaces} onto which the ellipsoidal model of the Earth is projected. The are mainly three geometric shapes that are used as reference surfaces: cylinders, cones and planes. The model is fitted in or on the surface touching it in at least one point or line. The idea is that there is a projection source from which rays are shot through the ellipsoid on the surface, projecting each point of the ellipsoid onto the surface (as seen in figure \ref{fig:projections}). This principle is known from the ray casting technique in computer graphics
\cite{mapProjectionGeokov}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.73\textwidth]{graphics/basics/projections}
  \caption{Three different developable surfaces for map projections \protect\footnotemark}

  last access: 27.10.2015
}

In praxis, also pure mathematical map projections are used, e.g. pseudocylindrical, sinusoidal or Mollweise projections. They are much more complex and have the goal to reduce the overall distortion
\cite[p.99]{bolstad2008gis}.

% subsection projection_families (end)


\paragraph{Distortion characteristics} % (fold)
\label{par:distortion_characteristics}

To flatten a spherical surface onto a flat surface, transformations such as stretching, tearing or shearing have to be performed. % affine? non-affine?
A map projection is only accurate at the \emph{standard lines}, i.e. the point(s) or line(s) where the developable surface touches or intersects the ellipsoid. In all other parts the map will in some ways be deformed. That causes distortion in at least one of the following properties of a map: shape (angle), size (area),  direction or distance of features on the map. There is no perfect map projection. Each projection can preserve maximum two of these properties at a cost of distorting the others. The cartographer has to make a compromise and choose a set of characteristics that are important while accepting a distortion in the other properties.

\emph{Tissot's indicatrices} visualize the distortion patterns in the form of ellipses on the map. Their size, shape and orientation are caused by the map projection and show the distortion at this point of the map. Using indicatrices the advantages and disadvantages of each map projection can be shown.

There are two mutual exclusive characteristics: \emph{equivalent} and \emph{conformal}. Equivalent projections preserve the sizes and areas of features on the map, whereas conformal projections preserves angles and the shapes of objects. Every map projection that is area-preserving distorts shapes at the same time, and vice versa
\cite{mapProjectionGeokov}.

The \emph{Mercator projection} (figure \ref{fig:lambert_vs_mercator}b) is an angle-preserving map. It was used for nautical navigation because of a very helpful property: constant compass bearing. A straight line on a Mercator map crosses all meridians in the same angle, a so called \emph{loxodrome}. A navigator only has to follow this line and never needs to reset the compass, because it will always point in the same direction. This is not the shortest way from A to B, but the easiest to navigate. The disadvantage of Mercator maps are the large area distortions towards the poles, which can be seen at the sizes of the ellipses. The best example visualizing the problem is Greenland: On the map it seems almost as large as Africa, whereas in reality Africa is 14 times larger than Greenland.
\cite{mapProjectionGeokov}

This scale becomes obvious in the area-preserving \emph{Lambert projection} (figure \ref{fig:lambert_vs_mercator}a). Tissot's indicatrices all have the same size, but their shapes get distorted towards the poles. This map shows the real size of Africa, but largely distorts the shape of Europe. However, for thematic mapping and teaching purposes equivalent projections are well-suited, because they accurately show the areas of the countries.
\cite{mapProjectionGeokov}

The result of an \emph{equidistant} projection is a map that in relation to the scale accurately shows the distances between certain points on the map.

Figure \ref{fig:equidistant_projections}b shows a prominent example: The Unites Nations chose a map for their logo from which all points on the map have the correct distance to the North Pole. The equirectangular projection in Figure \ref{fig:equidistant_projections}a has a slightly different property: any meridian is true to scale and therefore all distances along the meridians are accurate. However, the ellipses on the map are distorted in both shape and size, so the map is neither conformal nor equivalent. Air navigation charts or seismology make use of the equidistant property e.g. to show distances from major cities to the epicenter of an earthquake.
\cite{mapProjectionGeokov}

\emph{Zenithal} or \emph{azimuthal} projections preserve directions from the center point to all other points on the map (see figure \ref{fig:zenithal_projection}). It is only possible in the family of planar projections and can be combined with a conformal, equivalent and equidistant property. These maps are used whenever directional relationships are important, for example in navigational charts.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{graphics/basics/projection_distortion_azimuthal.png}

If no characteristic is explicitly important but the overall distortion shall be minimized, a \emph{compromise projection} can be used. They do not preserve any property, but are a trade-off in the distortion of all other properties. The Robinson projection in figure \ref{fig:robinson_projection} is a well-known example. All Tissot's indicatrices not on the Equator are distorted in size, shape and direction, but compared to the Mercator or Lambert projection, the magnitude of distortion is lower.

In summary,  The research focuses on changes over time triggered by historical events happening in an historical context. There are currently no historical information systems that scientists of this field use for their research, it is rather based on primary and secondary sources, e.h. historical documents, speeches or photography.

\emph{Historical} or \emph{temporal geographic information systems} (HGIS) combine elements of history and geography into one information system to be able to answer research questions for both historians and geographers: ``situating history in its geographical context and using geographic information to illuminate the past.''
\cite[p. 3]{knowles2008placing}
This manifests the interdisciplinary nature of HGIS and making it also an interesting technology in the context of \emph{digital humanities}, the intersection between humanities and computing. The main distinction to classical GIS is the integration of the component of time, making the system four-dimensional. HGIS collect, manage, analyze and present spatio-temporal information and models changes over time and space
\cite[p. xii]{knowles2002past}

there is ``not any operational temporal GIS''

The Map application delivers geospatial analytic capabilities. It combines the visualization of geo-located objects on a map with histogram, timeline and time wheel visualizations. A heatmap visualization illuminates the density of interesting objects on the map.

The imagery on the Map is fully pluggable, allowing users to switch between different sources of imagery, integrate private imagery, and create composite imagery sets that combine two or more sources of imagery.

KML and Shapefiles can be imported as independent map layers, and shapes contained in these layers can be used to select and filter objects that lie in a similar region (like a county, census plot, or state). Layers can be colored and labeled according to calculations performed on the data they contain.


Here is a group using the tool to do historical maps: http://envisioninghistory.org/


And here is a program Iâm using for my dissertation. I donât know if it does timelines and maps, but I think it might.

Here are some examples of what Iâm doing with it:

The major problem that lays in the nature of the qualitative historical research is that all historic sources are subjective and biased, their content may be fuzzy and they are definitely incomplete. So the knowledge that can be extracted from a source bears the integral problem of \emph{uncertainty}. On the other hand there are information systems with a logical architecture, with the goal to be as precise and accurate as possible. Analysis is based on mathematical functions -- in its entire nature an information system is quantitative. This contrast is the main problem why HGIS is not widely accepted yet
\cite[p. 2]{knowles2008placing}.

Another problem for historians is that they do not necessarily need a tool to better visualize existing knowledge (e.g. historical maps), but to generate new knowledge by analyzing spatio-temporal coherences or distributions in historical data. Spatio-temporal reasoning is still an open field and not easily possible with existing HGIS
\cite[p. 268]{knowles2008placing}, \cite[p. xii]{gregory2014toward}.

Some interesting research questions that could be answered using HGIS could be:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Did the European Union help to bring peace on the European continent or the other way around? (political)
  \item Is there a coherence between life expectancy and fertility rate on earth? (social)
  \item Does global warming speed up the melting of the glaciers? (physical)
  \item What was the contribution of Bismarck's foreign policy to a longer period of peace in Europe from 1871 to 1914? (historical)
\end{itemize}

Or on a more abstract level: Where and When has something changed and why did it change?


space-time premise by Gaddis 2002
  time and space equal importance
  event     what significantly has happend and by whom? (singularity!)
  process   how something has happened? (event+activity => trigger of process)
  change    driven by process
  spatiotemporal data defines all above three
