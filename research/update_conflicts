  SEC -> A does not exist anymore to secede from. T1 and T2 occupy exactly the same territory as A before
S)    => CONFLICT! a) keep Ti) or b) keep Bi
      -> if a)
-> A)    remove INC operation
      -> if b)
        it is impossible to say where Bi should secede from, since A does not exist anymore
-> M)    => CONFLICT! needs to be resolved manually

      -> secede both from T1 and T2, unify to new Area
