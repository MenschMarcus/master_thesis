step further: temporal GIS to narrative GIS

idea: explain history with spatial narratives
  geographically contextualize events and interactions
  organizing principle: time

extend the pure presentational purpose of st data to analytical purpose, e.g. where have most border changes take place in previous 200 years?

Another problem for historians is that they do not necessarily need a tool to better visualize existing knowledge (e.g. historical maps), but to generate new knowledge by analyzing spatio-temporal coherences or distributions in historical data. Spatio-temporal reasoning is still an open field and not easily possible with existing HGIS

space-time premise by Gaddis 2002
  time and space equal importance
  event     what significantly has happend and by whom? (singularity!)
  process   how something has happened? (event+activity => trigger of process)
  change    driven by process
  spatiotemporal data defines all above three
