\section{Application} % (fold)
\label{sec:application}

HistoGlobe is a Web-based Historical Geographic Information System. The Data model and the conceptual model of the user interface were introduced in the first two sections of this chapter. This section introduces the underlying database model, a specific implementation of the data model, and the computational model that translates between the conceptual model and the database model of the system.

The first part provides an overview about the architecture of the system in section \ref{sub:system_architecture}.
% ... bla bla bla, the rest comes last

% - backward change: all HG Operations and Edit Operations are inversible :)
% - support uncertainty

\subsection{System Architecture} % (fold)
\label{sub:system_architecture}

HistoGlobe uses a classical client-server architecture of a Web-based information system. The user opens the application and interacts with it through the user interface in a Web browser, the \emph{client} side of the system. The Web \emph{server} is a remote computer that hosts the database and the middleware. The user interacts with the interface, the client-side application sends a request to the Web server for new data. The middleware checks the request and queries the necessary data from the database. It transforms the data and sends it back to the client. The interface shows the new information.

  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{graphics/development/system_architecture}
  \caption{The system architecture of HistoGlobe}
  \label{fig:system_architecture}
\end{figure}

This clear separation between the data, the application and the user interaction in this chapter and in the system follows directly from the \emph{model-view-controller} pattern: One part can be changed independently from the others parts: if the 2D map is replaced by a 3D globe, only the view changes, but the middleware and the database can stay untouched. Likewise, the implementation of a new database technology has no consequences to the view.

\subsection{Hivent Database Model} % (fold)
\label{sub:database_model}

From the system point of view, the underlying data model explained in section \ref{sec:hivent_model} has to be implemented in a database model. HistoGlobe uses \emph{Django}, a free and open-source web framework
\footnote{
  \emph{Django},
  The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines,
  URL: \url{https://www.djangoproject.com/},
  last access: 27.05.2016
},
combined with \emph{PostgreSQL}
\footnote{
  \emph{PostgreSQL:},
  The world's most advanced open source database,
  URL: \url{http://www.postgresql.org/},
  last access: 31.10.2015
}
, one of the most popular Object-Relational Database Management Systems introduced in section \ref{sub:object_relational_database_management_systems}, on the server-side of the system. This allows HistoGlobe to take advantage of object-oriented concepts in a stable and fast relational database. Since the database is using a lot of geospatial data, the \emph{PostGIS} is used as a spatial database extension for PostgreSQL
\footnote{
  \emph{PostGIS},
  Spatial and Geographic Objects for PostgreSQL,
  URL: \url{http://postgis.net/},
  last access: 27.05.2016
}.

With these tools at hand, the database model shown in figure \ref{fig:database_model} was developed. It is the final result of a highly iterative process that underwent many improvements and adpations to new requirements introduced in the Human Centered Design process. The model is structured in two parts: The lower part describes the semantic, spatial and thematic domain of Areas, their names and territories. The upper part represents the temporal domain that introduces changes to the entities of the other three domains. It is the core of the spatio-temporal \emph{Hivent Database Model}.

\paragraph{Reduction to HG Operations} % (fold)
\label{par:reduction_to_hg_operations}

The conceptual model promotes six Edit Operations (see section \ref{sub:edit_operations}) that humans can understand.
The underlying data model is based on five HG Operations (see section \ref{tab:historical_geographic_operations}) that can model all evolutionary changes to countries in time and space. The task for the computational model of HistoGlobe is to translate between both operation sets.

% wording:
% UNI of "[old]"  to    "new"
% INC of "[old]"  into  "pres"
% SEP of "old"    into  "[new]"
% SEC of "[new]"  from  "pres"
% NCH of "pres"

Each Edit Operation will internally be expressed by a set of Historical Geographic Operations that describe the change on a low level. Depending on the input of the user in the Edit Operation steps, there are different possibilities. They are introduced in table \ref{tab:editoperations_to_hg_operations}.

A main problem is to maintain the integrity of the spatial topology when a new change gets inserted not at the end of the list. A simple example shows that problem: Given geo-object $X$ is part of the inital base configuration at change $t_b$. At a later change, e.g. $t_y$ $X$ gets replaced by object $Y$. If a new change that updates $X$ to $X'$ gets inserted before at time point $t_x < t_y$, then $t_y$ is not integer anymore, because object $X$ does not exist. That is why on insertion of a change, all succeeding changes have to be tested for integrity and it might be necessary to update later changes.
