The aim of this thesis is to create a Historical Geographic Information System to visualize and edit the evolution of countries in time and space. This is a complicated task, because both the reality and the human using the system are complex. For such complex applications the methodologies of \emph{Human Centered Design} are promising to create an interface that humans can easily understand.

The development process is iterative and divided in several phases. In each phase creates a prototype or the interface that gets closer to the final solution by increasing the fidelity of the prototype. A phase starts with an initial set of requirements. In multiple iterations, a prototype is developed that solves the problem. Each iteration has four steps: The requirements for the system are analyzed in the \emph{planning} step. Afterwards, they translated into an abstract \emph{design} which is realized in a specific \emph{implementation} of the prototype. Finally, this prototype is tested with humans to find out how well it works. Based on the results of this \emph{testing} step, the requirements are updated and the next iteration starts. This is repeated until a version of the interface is created that sufficiently solves the problem. Then the fidelity is increased, starting the next development phase. The five phases in this thesis are shown in figure \ref{fig:hcd}.

There are several models involved in the development of the software, each of them has to be developed or analyzed separately. The \emph{data model} is an abstraction and simplification of the real world. The \emph{Hivent Model} developed in this thesis is explained in the first section \ref{sec:hivent_model} of this chapter. It follows the method to \emph{edit} the spatio-temporal data in the system in section \ref{sec:editing_hivent_data}. In iteractive computer systems, the \emph{mental model} is the representation in the mind of the human about how the interface should work -- the \emph{conceptual model} describes the way the interface actually works. The goal of Human Centered Design is to match the conceptual model to the mental model. Section \ref{sec:user_interface_design_process} outlines the gradual design process to reach this goal. In the application, the data model is implemented in the \emph{database model}. The task for the \emph{computational model} is to translate between the database model and the conceptual model. The HistoGlobe application, including the database and computational model, is introduced in the last section \ref{sec:application} of this chapter.
