The aim of this thesis is to create a Historical Geographic Information System to visualize and edit the evolution of countries in time and space. This is a complicated task, because both the reality and the human that should be able to use the system are complex. The task is to create an interface that a human can easily understand and use. For complex applications in which the interface matters, the methodologies of \emph{Human Centered Design} are promising to achieve a good solution.

The development process is iterative divided in several phases. In each phase, the fidelty towards the final solution is increased. A phase starts with an initial set of requirements about the problem. In multiple iterations, an interface is developed that solves the problem. Each iteration has four steps: The requirements for the system are analyzed in the \emph{planning} step. Afterwards, they translated into an abstract \emph{design} which is realized in a specific \emph{implementation} of the interface. Finally, this interface is tested with humans to find out how well it works. Based on the results of this \emph{testing} step, the requirements are updated and the next iteration starts. This is repeated until a version of the interface is created that sufficiently solves the problem. Then the fidelity is increased, starting the next development phase.

The five phases in this thesis were:
\begin{compactenum}
  \item \textbf{Idea}: The initial idea how to edit and visualize the history of countries.
  \item \textbf{Paper Prototype}: The concept of the interface realized and tested on paper.
  \item \textbf{Mockup Prototype}: The concrete workflow developed in a slide-based presentation.
  \item \textbf{Web-Based Prototype}: The final version developed in a Web application.
  \item \textbf{Extensions}: Design approaches how to fit the uncertain nature of history.
\end{compactenum}

There are several models involved in the development of the software, each of them has to be developed or analyzed separately. The \emph{data model} is an abstraction and simplification of the real world. The \emph{Hivent Model} created in this thesis is explained in the first section \ref{sec:hivent_model} of this chapter. In iteractive computer systems, the \emph{mental model} is the representation in the mind of the human about how the interface he or she is interacting with should work. On the other hand, the \emph{conceptual model} describes the way the interface actually works. The goal of Human Centered Design is to match the conceptual model to the mental model. Section \ref{sec:user_interface} outlines the gradual interface design process to reach this goal. In the application, the implemented \emph{database model} has to match the abstract data model. The task for the \emph{computational model} is to translate between the database model and the conceptual model. The working of the HistoGlobe application, including the computational model, is introduced in the last section \ref{sec:application} of this chapter.
