\subsubsection{Hivent} % (fold)
\label{ssub:hivent}

models historically significant happenings with a focus on those who influence the geopolitical history of countries.

In modern history, geopolitical changes of countries are manifested mostly in historical treaties which are the result of a conference or any other gathering of representatives of stakeholders of that initiated change. Since each of those treaties is signed on one particular day, in one particular place and has one particular name, the ~\texttt{Hivent}~ model seems appropriate.

However, the first question arises regarding the relevance of the location: While the exact position of the battlefield of Verdun or the place where John F. Kennedy was assassinated might very relevant to the event itself, the location of a governmental bill, a declaration of independence or a border convention might not play an important role and usually happens in a representative place, e.g. the parliament or the office of a president. In a lot of cases, it is much more important which territories an event actually influences instead of where it happened.

\subsubsection{Area} % (fold)
\label{ssub:area}

model the main entity of the domain: historical or current countries. An ~\texttt{Area}~ represents one identical country, consisting at each time point of its existance of exactly one ~\texttt{AreaName}~ and one ~\texttt{AreaTerritory}. The model seems appropriate since the name and the territory of an area are exactly the two properties that are part of the domain.
