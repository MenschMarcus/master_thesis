The work on this Master's Thesis began in October 2015 and ended in June 2016. I want to thank my supervisors Prof. Volker Rodehorst and Prof. Sven Bertel for the continuous advices, ideas and the motivation to work on this topic of my choice.

I spent the majority of the time of this thesis (October-December 2015 and February-May 2016) at \emph{Scholars' Lab} of \emph{University of Virginia}. I was provided with an excellent workspace, very cooperative people and delicious oatmeal raisin cookies -- all of which contributed to a great work atmosphere in Charlottesville, Virginia. I especially want to thank all the members of the \emph{Scholars' Lab} that were always eager to solve my problems regarding the concept and the implementation of this thesis, especially Ammon, Eric, Scott, Purdom, Jeremy, Chris, Wayne, Ronda, Laura, Becca, Shane and Veronica. The perspective of humanity scholars on my project were very valuable for me personally and for my work.

Since this thesis was an advancement of HistoGlobe, the project I founded in 2010, I want to thank everybody that has ever been involved in this project. In the previous 6 years I learned how to (not) make a project successful that almost everybody likes. Special thanks goes to Frej with whom I developed the first prototype in 2011. From 2012 on, my coworkers, fellow students and friends Simon and Felix deserve great credit for everything they did to HistoGlobe and me. Their implementation of the current state of HistoGlobe was the basis of this work. I also want to thank the other developers that spent their free time, ideas and coding skills on the HistoGlobe project: Sascha, Sebastian, Lene, Max, Chris and Sebastian. Thank you Christian for always burning for HistoGlobe and trying to make the project profitable. I am also thankful for Carola and Katrin who spent significant free time on HistoGlobe in 2013. Last but not least a huge Thank You to my friend and colleague Tobias for your high efforts for the HistoGlobe project, great concepts and stunning designs. I learned from you how valuable good design is.

Thank you, \emph{Bauhaus-Universit√§t Weimar} and all the associated professors and academic staff at this great institution, for the support throughout the previous seven years. The history and the values of the Bauhaus always inspired me and are a big part of how I think, design and create.

Finally, I want to thank my family that has always been there for me thourghout the first 26 years of my life. I studied for seven years, had three longer stays abroad and spent some of my time with entrepreneurial ideas instead of my studies. But nonetheless, my parents, my brother, my sister and the rest of my family always supported me. This feeling is invaluable and I am thankful for it.

Last but not least: Thank you, John Oliver and \emph{Last Week's Tonight}. It was the best possible distraction for the work on my thesis.
