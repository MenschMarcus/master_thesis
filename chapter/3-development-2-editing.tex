\section{Editing Hivent Data} % (fold)
\label{sec:editing_hivent_data}

The previous section proposed the abstract Hivent Model, a set of Hivent operations and a visualization method. However, one purpose of the HGIS developed in this thesis is to add, alter and delete historical changes. This section presents the tools and methods to edit spatio-temporal data about the evolution of Areas in the Hivent Model. Whereas the Hivent Operations are well-defined and specific, user studies have shown that they are not well understood by humans to edit Areas. This thesis therefore introduces a different set of six \emph{Edit Operations} in section \ref{sub:edit_operations}. Afterwards, section \ref{sub:edit_workflow} shows a \emph{workflow} to perform an Edit Operation step by step. The Hivent Model needs to support editing historical changes in between other historical changes. The last section \ref{sub:retrospective_updates} explains the theoretical approach to \emph{retrospecitve updates} of spatio-temporal data in the Hivent Model.

\subsection{Edit Operations} % (fold)
\label{sub:edit_operations}

The Hivent Operations are valuable, because they can describe all possible changes in the evolution of Areas in time and space. They are really well understood from the system point of view and form the basis for the Hivent Model. However, one purpose of the HGIS developed in this thesis is to provide a well understood user interface to edit historical changes to Areas.

Throughout the development process, interviews with researchers in humanities at University of Virginia were conducted to understand their mental model about the task. It turned out that the Hivent Operations are not suitable to be used for human edit purposes, because of their low-level nature. One example is that the operations do not provide a straightforward way to create a new Area on previously unclaimed land. The same is true for changing the formal name of an Area. Therefore, this thesis introduces a second set of operations: five high-level \emph{Edit Operations} describe changes to countries on the map (see table \ref{tab:edit_operations}). They have proven to be understandable in several user studies.

\subsection{Edit Workflow} % (fold)
\label{sub:edit_workflow}

An Edit Operation describes an historical change that can be understood and performed by a user of the HGIS. This section shows that each Edit Operation can be internally expressed by a set of Hivent Operations. Therefore the Edit Operations are an abstraction layer in the Hivent Model between the Hivent and the Hivent Operations. To create an Edit Operation, four steps in a workflow need to be performed:

\begin{compactenum}
  \item Select the Areas that will be changed in the Edit Operation.
  \item For each new Area resulting from the Edit Operation, create a territory.
  \item For each new Area create a name.
  \item Add the Edit Operation to an Hivent to inherit the time point.
\end{compactenum}

For each Edit Operation, the requirements for the steps are different. Not all operations need all steps, because some data can be processed automatically. Table \ref{tab:editoperations_in_worklow} presents an overview about the behaviour of the Edit Operations in the first three steps. The last step is necessary for all.

Depending on the input of the user in the steps for an Edit Operation, there are different possibilities to express it by a set of Hivent Operations. Each Hivent Operation transforms a set of old Areas into a set of new Areas and can update the name or territory of one specific Area. All possibilities are introduced in table \ref{tab:editoperations_to_hg_operations}. Hivent Operations are combined when they happen at the same time. In the example of the German Reunification, East Germany was incorporated into West Germany which at the same time changed its short name to ``Germany'' (\texttt{INC + NCH}).

\subsection{Retrospective Updates} % (fold)
\label{sub:retrospective_updates}

A straighforward use case of the Hivent Model is to change the current state of the system with a new Edit Operation into the future. Givent the initial start point $t_0$, a current time point $t_{now} > t_0$ and a set of consecutively added Hivent Operations at $t_i \in [t_0 .. t_{now}[$. The accumulation of all changes make up the current state of the system at $t_{now}$. To change this current state, a new Hivent Operation can be inserted at $t_{now}$ into the future as a \emph{forward operation}. This state is valid until the next change is inserted.

For the purpose of historical research this use case alone is not sufficient, because the current state $t_{now}$ of the map is known to large degree. The problem is to edit states in the past. For this purpose the concept of a \emph{backward operation} comes into play: A Hivent Operation is inserted at time point $t_i$, but into the past: $ t_0 < t_i < t_{now}$. As an example: Given the initial state 10.06.2016 with present-day Germany created on 03.10.1990 on the map. The user wants to enter the German Reunification. The HGIS must support separating Germany into East and West, but indicating that this was the state \emph{before} 1990 and the original state was \emph{after} this date. This is complicated, because the conceptual, data and computational model have to adapt to this requirement.

The Hivent Operations themselves allow to be executed the other way, because each of them has an inverse operation: A \texttt{UNI} can be inverted with a \texttt{SEP} and a \texttt{INC} with a \texttt{SEC} operation. \texttt{NCH} can be inverted with itself by swapping the old and new name.

\paragraph{Consistency} % (fold)
\label{par:consistency}

Each Hivent Operation that is not entered as a \emph{forward operation} to the end of the timeline must maintain the semantic, spatial and thematic integrity of the data, i.e. the changes to Areas, their territories and names must still work. All possible conflicts with consecutive Hivent Operations have to be resolved. The simple example in figure \ref{fig:update_conflict_example} shows the problem: Given time point $t_1$ with two Areas $A$ and $B$ and an \texttt{UNI} Hivent Operation at $t_2$ unifying $A$ and $B$ to $C$. If in retrospective a new Hivent Operation is inserted at $t_r: t_1 < t_r < t_2$ that cedes a part of of $A$ to a new Area $X$, the operation at $t_2$ is not consistent anymore, because the old territory of $A$ is not the same. It is not simple to say how the remaining territory $?$ should be treated.

The way the Hivent Model works is comparable to a version control system like \emph{Git}
\footnote{
  \emph{Git},
  --everything-is-local,
  \url{https://git-scm.com/},
  last access: 29.05.2016
}
Just like in Git, there are different kinds of conflicts that can occur on retrospective updates. In this model, they are classified regarding their resolvability:

\begin{compactenum}
  \item[A)] The conflict can be resolved \emph{\textbf{a}utomatically} without the interference of the user.
  \item[S)] The conflict requires the user to choose between two alternatives (\emph{\textbf{s}emi-automatic} resolution).
  \item[M)] The conflict is complex and the user needs to resolve it \emph{\textbf{m}anually}.
\end{compactenum}

The remaining part of this section examines all possible cases of conflicts and their resolveability. Each inserted Hivent Operation transforms a set of old Areas $A = [A_i]$ to a set of new Areas $B = [B_i]$ or updates an update Area $A_0$ or both. Each consecutive Hivent Operation that manipulates $A_0, A_i \in A$ or $B_i \in B$ has to be checked regarding three aspects of integrity:

\begin{compactenum}
  \item semantic: Does $A_0$ and $\forall A_i \in A$ still exist? If not, can it easily be replaced by another Area?
  \item spatial: Is the territory of $A_0$ and $\forall A_i \in A$ still the same? If not, can it easily by updated?
  \item thematic: Is the name of $A_0$ and $\forall A_i \in A$ still the same? If not, can it easily be updated?
\end{compactenum}

All cases can be broken down to the following scenario. Given an initial state at $t_1$ with three spatial entities on the map ($A_1, A_2, A_3$) and an Hivent Operation at $t_2$ manipulating this set of Areas with one of the five possible operations. This is operation is consistent and is called the original Hivent Operation ($H_o$). Now, a retrospective update $H_r$ with one of the five Hivent Operations manipulating the same set of Areas is inserted at $t_r: t_1 < t_r < t_2$. What happens regarding the semantic, spatial and thematic integrity of $H_o$? There are 25 possible cases, because there are 5 different $H_o$ and five different $H_r$ operations.

Correcting wrong information in an event-based system is important to understand: Given time point $t_y$ and an Area $A$ with the name $X$. If $X$ happens to be wrong, it means that the historical change at time point $t_x: t_x < t_y$ that created the name $X$ into Area $A$ is erroneous and has be corrected. Correcting a state means correcting the event that created this state.
